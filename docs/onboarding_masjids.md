# Masjid Calendar Onboarding Guide

**For Masjid Administrators and Event Coordinators**

Welcome! This guide explains how to share your Google Calendar with BayanLab so your community events can appear in The Ummah app and other community platforms.

## What is BayanLab?

BayanLab (*BAYĀN = clarity*) aggregates Muslim community events and halal businesses across Colorado and beyond. We collect event data from masjid calendars and make it available through:
- **The Ummah** mobile app (events)
- **ProWasl** (halal businesses)
- Public API for other community tools

---

## Your Privacy Matters

🔒 **Your calendar stays private.** We don't make your calendar public. You simply share it with our service account (like sharing with a specific person). You can:
- ✅ Revoke access anytime
- ✅ Control what we see (only shared calendars)
- ✅ Keep your calendar private from public search engines

## Event Best Practices

To help your events display well in the app:

### Use Clear Event Titles
✅ **Good**: "Jumu'ah Prayer - Second Khutbah"
❌ **Avoid**: "Friday thing"

### Include Location Details
✅ **Good**: Add full masjid address in location field
❌ **Avoid**: Just "Main Hall"

### Add Descriptions
✅ **Good**: Brief description, speaker name, registration link
❌ **Avoid**: Leaving description empty

### Set Correct Times
✅ **Good**: Use actual event times (e.g., 1:30 PM - 2:00 PM)
❌ **Avoid**: All-day events for specific-time activities

## Sample Event

**Title**: Jumu'ah (Friday Prayer) - Second Khutbah

**Time**: Every Friday, 1:30 PM - 2:00 PM (Mountain Time)

**Location**: Islamic Center of Northern Colorado, 2555 S Shields St, Fort Collins, CO 80526
